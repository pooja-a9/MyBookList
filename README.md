When your application requests private data, the request must be authorized by an authenticated user who has access to that data.

In particular, all operations under "My Library" in the Google Books API are considered to be private and require authentication and authorization. In addition, any operation that modifies Google Books data can be performed only by the user who owns that data.

When your application requests public data, the request doesn't need to authorized, but does need to be accompanied by an identifier, such as an API key.
